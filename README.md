THE MASTER PASSWORD IS : "ziad"
A few notes to be considered:
When running the application, make sure you run it with the required permissions to allow file creation and file reading (Creating the password text files to store and retrieve the passwords).
make sure you run the application within the same path location where the password text file is created (for example, running the program on the desktop, while also having the password text file stored on the desktop).
